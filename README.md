                                    Reckless- The Driving Game

“Reckless” is a simple game made using the Pygame module in Python. It is a simple racing game. The objective is to score maximum points by travelling the maximum distance without crashing into the incoming traffic. The game is controlled using the typical gaming keys like the “up”, “down”, “left” and “right” keys. 
                    The game consists of seven sprites in the scripts folder. Three of the sprites are incoming traffic, one the player and two border walls and a header. Crashing into any of these sprites other than the header can lead to the player losing. Each player has three lives in total, the exhaustion of these three lives will end the game and the total score shall be calculated. All the code is condensed into the main.py file in the folder
The game is titled Reckless because it aims at driving the car onto the incoming traffic, avoiding them and setting the highest score you can.
